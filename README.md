# Inverse Properties

An [Omeka S](https://omeka.org/s/) module for defining inverse relations between
properties.

This module allows administrators to define inverse relations between properties
so that they can be concretely linked in both directions. In effect, it enables
a custom implementation of [owl:inverseOf](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref/#inverseOf-def).
