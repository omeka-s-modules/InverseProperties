# Inverse Properties

An [Omeka S](https://omeka.org/s/) module for defining inverse properties between
resources.

This module allows administrators to define inverse properties between resources
(items, item sets, media) so that property values can be concretely linked in both
directions. In effect, it enables a custom implementation of [owl:inverseOf](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref/#inverseOf-def)
integrated with Omeka S resource templates.
